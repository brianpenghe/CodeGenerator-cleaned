# Code generator instructions
* This is a set of scripts to generate command-line scripts to handle sequencing data (the codes to write [codes](https://github.com/brianpenghe/Luo_2021_piRNA))
* It generates codes to download data from Igor's website and codes for sequencing analysis

## [smallRNA-seq](https://github.com/brianpenghe/CodeGenerator/blob/master/smallRNA-seq.md)
* downloading, trimming, genome mapping, vector mapping, bin calculation, ping-pong analyses etc.
* more information about the generated code can be found [here](https://github.com/brianpenghe/Luo_2021_piRNA/blob/main/piRNA-seq.md)
## [totalRNA-seq/RIP-seq](https://github.com/brianpenghe/CodeGenerator/blob/master/totalRNA-seq__OR__RIP.md)
* downloading, trimming, rRNA removal, transcriptome mapping, vector mapping, bin calculation, phasing etc.
## [polyA-RNA-seq]()
* downloading, trimming, transcriptome mapping, FPKM/TPM calculation, track generation etc.
## [ATAC-seq]()
* downloading, trimming, genome mapping, normalization, peak calling, track generation etc. 
## [4C-seq]()
